Hey ho
------

Hi, I'm Julien Pauli. I've been contributing to PHP for years, and I'm one of the release managers of PHP 5.5 and PHP 5.6.
I'm french, living in Paris, and working at [Sensiolabs](http://www.sensiolabs.com).

I like sharing my knowledge of PHP internals, to show external people how the language works. I'm the co-author of <http://www.phpinternalsbook.com>. Designing a web, cross platform, highly used, open source language (PHP) is a very challenging task I really enjoy.
I'm just yet another technical guy that can't do anything with a pen but a keyboard :-)

I studied electronic systems at school, programming in VHDL, 68HC11 and finally X86.
I'm now a Linux system programmer, meaning I mainly write/debug C code under Linux (rarely assembly). I got interest in the Linux Kernel and
OS design as well, I really enjoy asking the hardware to do something. In the past, I've been contributing
to projects like ZendFramework 1, so I'm also a PHP language user. Today, when it comes to play with PHP, I highly use Symfony2 framework.
